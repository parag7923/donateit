#  DonateIt Project README

Welcome to the DonateIt project! This project is a decentralized application built on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain.
It utilizes the Motoko programming language for the backend and React for the frontend. This README will guide you through the project structure, setup, and usage.


### Frontend (React)

The frontend of the project is built using the React framework. 
It provides a user interface for interacting with the `DonateIt` smart contract on the Internet Computer blockchain. 

### Backend (Motoko)

The backend of the project is implemented in Motoko, a programming language designed for building applications on the Internet Computer blockchain. 

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- Familiarity with React and smart contracts.



## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:



```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start 

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```
